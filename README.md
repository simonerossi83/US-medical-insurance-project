# US-medical-insurance-project

US medical insurance capstone project off CodeCademy Data Science path

This work is made of CodeCademy capstone project, which is at about 25% of the course in Data Science. In this file I am going to analyze data taken from the Medical Cost Personal Datasets provided on Kaggle. I am learning Python, I know that I could use different libraries such as `numpy` or `pandas`, but I am using the methods I have learned so far! :)

## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to give an overview of the data provided. I am going to explore:

- is there a bias towards gender?
- what is the maximum, minimum and average age of the individuals?
- what is the correlation between BMI and age?
- how many people are smokers?
- what is the age of smokers and non smokers?
- what is the distribution of people in the 4 different regions?
- I will try also to find the correlation between the charges and the other variable
